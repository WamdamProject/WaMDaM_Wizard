Usage
-----

To get system metadata for public resources:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare()
    >>> for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>     print(resource)

To authenticate using HTTP Basic authentication, and then get system metadata for resources you have access to:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare, HydroShareAuthBasic
    >>> auth = HydroShareAuthBasic(username='myusername', password='mypassword')
    >>> hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)
    >>> for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>     print(resource)

To authenticate using OAuth2 authentication (using a user and password supplied by the user), and then get a list of
resources you have access to:

    >>> from oauthlib.oauth2 import TokenExpiredError
    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare, HydroShareAuthOAuth2
    >>>
    >>> # Get a client ID and client secret by registering a new application at:
    >>> # https://www.hydroshare.org/o/applications/
    >>> # Choose client type "Confidential" and authorization grant type "Resource owner password-based"
    >>> # Keep these secret!
    >>> client_id = 'MYCLIENTID'
    >>> client_secret = 'MYCLIENTSECRET'
    >>>
    >>> auth = HydroShareAuthOAuth2(client_id, client_secret,
    >>>                             username='myusername', password='mypassword')
    >>> hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)
    >>>
    >>> try:
    >>>     for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>         print(resource)
    >>> except TokenExpiredError as e:
    >>>     hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)
    >>>    for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>         print(resource)

Note that currently the client does not handle token renewal, hence the need to catch TokenExpiredError.

To authenticate using OAuth2 authentication (using an existing token), and then get a list of resources you have
access to:

    >>> from oauthlib.oauth2 import TokenExpiredError
    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare, HydroShareAuthOAuth2
    >>>
    >>> # Get a client ID and client secret by registering a new application at:
    >>> # https://www.hydroshare.org/o/applications/
    >>> # Choose client type "Confidential" and authorization grant type "Resource owner password-based"
    >>> # Keep these secret!
    >>> client_id = 'MYCLIENTID'
    >>> client_secret = 'MYCLIENTSECRET'
    >>>
    >>> # A token dictionary obtained separately from HydroShare of the form:
    >>> #   {
    >>> #       "access_token": "<your_access_token>",
    >>> #       "token_type": "Bearer",
    >>> #       "expires_in": 36000,
    >>> #       "refresh_token": "<your_refresh_token>",
    >>> #       "scope": "read write groups"
    >>> #   }
    >>>
    >>> # get_token() is a stand in for how you get a new token on your system.
    >>> token = get_token()
    >>> auth = HydroShareAuthOAuth2(client_id, client_secret,
    >>>                             token=token)
    >>> try:
    >>>     hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)
    >>>     for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>         print(resource)
    >>> except:
    >>>     # get_token() is a stand in for how you get a new token on your system.
    >>>     token = get_token()
    >>>     auth = HydroShareAuthOAuth2(client_id, client_secret,
    >>>                                 token=token)
    >>>     hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)
    >>>     for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>         print(resource)

Note that currently the client does not handle token renewal, hence the need to catch TokenExpiredError.

To connect to a development HydroShare server that uses a self-sign security certificate:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare(hostname='mydev.mydomain.net', verify=False)
    >>> for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>     print(resource)

To connect to a development HydroShare server that is not running HTTPS:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare(hostname='mydev.mydomain.net', port=8000, use_https=False)
    >>> for resource in hs.resources():
    >>>     print(resource)

Note that authenticated connections **must** use HTTPS.

To get the system metadata for a particular resource:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare()
    >>> resource_md = hs.getSystemMetadata('e62a438bec384087b6c00ddcd1b6475a')
    >>> print(resource_md['resource_title'])

To get the BagIt archive of a particular resource:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare()
    >>> hs.getResource('e62a438bec384087b6c00ddcd1b6475a', destination='/tmp')

or to have the BagIt archive unzipped for you:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare()
    >>> hs.getResource('e62a438bec384087b6c00ddcd1b6475a', destination='/tmp', unzip=True)

or to get the BagIt archive as a generator (sort of like a buffered stream):

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare()
    >>> resource = hs.getResource('e62a438bec384087b6c00ddcd1b6475a')
    >>> with open('/tmp/myresource.zip', 'wb') as fd:
    >>>     for chunk in resource:
    >>>         fd.write(chunk)

Note that when the BagIt archive is not ready for download (this archive zip file needs to be
recreated) the client by default will wait until the BagIt archive is recreated. This may take a
while. If you want to get the BagIt archive only if it is ready for download:

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare
    >>> hs = HydroShare()
    >>>try:
    >>>     hs.getResource('e62a438bec384087b6c00ddcd1b6475a', destination='/tmp', wait_for_bag_creation=False)
    >>>except HydroShareBagNotReadyException as e:
    >>>     print('BagIt file is being generated and not ready for download at this time.')

    >>> title = 'My resource'
    >>> keywords = ('my keyword 1', 'my keyword 2')
    >>> rtype = 'GenericResource'
    >>> fpath = '/path/to/a/file'

Alternatively, you can use the helper functions:

    >>>  hs.resource('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE').public(True) # or False
    >>>  hs.resource('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE').discoverable(True) # or False
    >>>  hs.resource('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE').shareable(True) # or False

                              north="50",
                              south="30",
                              east="40",
                              west="20")

To discover resources via other parameters

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare, HydroShareAuthBasic
    >>> auth = HydroShareAuthBasic(username='myusername', password='mypassword')
    >>> hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)

    >>> # Discover via creator, group, user, owner
    >>> resources = hs.resources(creator="username")
    >>> resources = hs.resources(user="username")
    >>> resources = hs.resources(owner="username")
    >>> resources = hs.resources(author="username")
    >>> resources = hs.resources(group="id or name")

**from_date** allows you to specify the earliest creation date to query for

**to_date** allows you to specify the latest creation date to query for

    >>> # Discover via date range (datetime objects)
    >>> resources = hs.resources(from_date=datetime, to_date=datetime)

**start** allows you to specify the index of the resource to start querying from

**count** allows you to specify how many resources to include in the query results

    >>> # Discover via start or count (integers)
    >>> resources = hs.resources(start=4)
    >>> resources = hs.resources(count=4)

    >>> # Discover via full text search
    >>> resources = hs.resources(full_text_search="any text here")

    >>> # Discover via flags (boolean)
    >>> resources = hs.resources(published=False)
    >>> resources = hs.resources(edit_permission=False)
    >>> resources = hs.resources(public=False)

    >>> # Discover via resource type
    >>> resources = hs.resources(type=None)

To get a list of all resource files

    >>> # List all resource files
    >>> hs.resource('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE').files.all()

To get file metadata

    >>> # Get FILE_ID from above call to files.all()
    >>> hs.resource('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE').files.metadata(FILE_ID)

To set file metadata

    >>> # This is a PUT request so the entire object, all parameters are overwritten
    >>> params = {}
    >>> params['keywords'] = ["keyword1","keyword2"]
    >>> params['spatial_coverage'] = {
            "units":"Decimal degrees",
            "east":-90.0465,
            "north":48.6791,
            "name":"12232",
            "projection":"WGS 84 EPSG:4326"
        }
    >>> params['temporal_coverage'] = {"start":"2018-02-23","end":"2018-02-29"}
    >>> params['extra_metadata'] = {"extended1":"one"}
    >>> params['title'] = "New Metadata Title"
    >>> hs.resource('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE').files.metadata(FILE_ID, params)

To set a file to a file type (e.g., NetCDF) in a composite resource:
Note: Allowed file type are: NetCDF, GeoRaster and GeoFeature

    >>> from hs_restclient import HydroShare, HydroShareAuthBasic
    >>> auth = HydroShareAuthBasic(username='myusername', password='mypassword')
    >>> hs = HydroShare(auth=auth)
    >>> options = {
                     "file_path": "file.nc",
                     "hs_file_type": "NetCDF"
			      }
    >>> result = hs.resource('ID OF RESOURCE GOES HERE').functions.set_file_type(options)
