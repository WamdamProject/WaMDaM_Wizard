The viewer folder constains all the GUI python files mainly generated by wxformbuilder.
Each file has events that are linked to the controller.

The Viewer is supposed to be as independent as possible from the Model and the Controller. Any changes to the
look and feel of the viewer or GUI will not affect the rest of the Wizard.

WaMDaMWizard.py contain the core of the Wizard GUI.

The frm_Home.py handles the events in the main GUI represented by WaMDaMWizard.py file

The rest of the files are like for dialog boxes and contain the events inside them
