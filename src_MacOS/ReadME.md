## src_MacOS

This directory contains the Wizard's source code 1.01 that was updated and tested on a MacOS. The changes were limited to the viewer. Although wxpython is compatible between Windows and MacOS, the wxpython library version for MacOS was more recent the windows one which created many bugs. 

So there is a need to go back to the original source code for Windows and update all its code to the most recent wxpython library and upgrade from Python 2x into Python 3x. Python 2x will retire by 2020 https://pythonclock.org/

Future work will look into such updates and whether to stick into wxpython for the viewer or overhaul it into better libraries like PyQt for visual and performance enhancements        

If you're interested in running the Wizard on a MacOS, please contact me and I'll do my best. It's a priority issue to me.
